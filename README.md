# Responsive infographic

- Approx. completion time: **many hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file (or more), images**

---

**Take an infographic created in an earlier class and convert it to a responsive interactive website.**

Using the assets from the Adobe Illustrator infographic you created in David Bromley’s class, create a responsive website.

- You’re welcome to simplify it a little—maybe picking 2–3 of the best bits.
- There doesn’t need to be animations or transitions yet—but you’re welcome to add them.
- Try to put as much of the SVG code into your HTML as you can.
